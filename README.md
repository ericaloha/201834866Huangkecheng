# Huangkecheng's DataMining Task

## (1) using KV db redis to store my info like TF , IDF and so on , which worked well.

## (2) Experiment Data is upload to github called Exp.zip.

### (3) Problem: Coz I mismatch the sequence of file and word ,so I got a wrong output of KNN model,I will trans my db model to a case which matching TFIDF model well.
