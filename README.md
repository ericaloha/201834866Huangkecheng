##Huangkecheng's DataMining Task

#(1) using KV db redis to store my info like TF , IDF and so on , which worked well.

#(2) Experiment Data is upload to github called Exp.zip.

#(3) Problem: Coz I foget to remain data for testing ,so I get other files online from The Economist to figure out the accurancy of my      model, actually the accuancy is not well,I input 20 files and only 9 are in their right position(by my own judgement), I need to change the param K for further testing
